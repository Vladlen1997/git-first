sword and spear
wall of shields
standing strong
on this their chosen battle field
form the lines
shield by shield
Oh sometimes

(Every time I try to make myself get back up on my feet
(All I ever think about is this)
(All the tiring time between)
(And how trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me)
